Description: Provides tools and data pipelines to support Essential Life Support
    Areas (ELSA) conservation planning. Includes functions to load and harmonize
    global spatial datasets, prepare raster layers for spatial prioritization,
    create zone layers (protect, restore, manage), and calculate coverage metrics
    over planning units.
