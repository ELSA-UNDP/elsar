\title{Calculate Target Area from Percentage}
\usage{
get_target(pu = NULL, target = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{pu}{A \code{SpatRaster} representing the planning units, where the total
area is calculated.}

\item{target}{A numeric value representing the percentage target (e.g., 10
for 10\%).}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the target area. If the calculated
target is zero, returns a very small value (1e-4) to ensure a non-zero
target.
}
\description{
Calculates a target value by taking a percentage of the total area
represented by the planning units (PU). The result is rounded to the nearest
whole number, and if the calculated target is zero, a small value (1e-4) is
returned to avoid issues with zero targets in optimization.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Calculate target for 10\% of planning units
get_target(pu = my_planning_units_raster, target = 10)
}
