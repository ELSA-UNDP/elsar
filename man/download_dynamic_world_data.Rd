\title{Download Google Dynamic World Annual Composite}
\usage{
download_dynamic_world_data(
  boundary_layer,
  iso3,
  gee_project,
  output_dir = here::here(),
  year = NULL,
  pus = NULL,
  aggregate_to_pus = FALSE,
  wait_time = 5,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{boundary_layer}{An \code{sf} object defining the spatial boundary of interest.}

\item{iso3}{Character. Three-letter ISO country code for filename generation.}

\item{gee_project}{Character. Google Earth Engine cloud project ID. This is
required and must be a valid GEE project you have access to. Find your
project ID in the \href{https://code.earthengine.google.com/}{GEE Code Editor}.}

\item{output_dir}{Character. Local output directory. Defaults to project root via \code{here::here()}.}

\item{year}{Numeric or NULL. Year for the annual composite. If NULL (default),
uses the previous calendar year.}

\item{pus}{SpatRaster or NULL. Planning units raster for GEE-side aggregation.
When provided with \code{aggregate_to_pus = TRUE}, the export will be resampled
to match the PU resolution and projection in GEE before download.}

\item{aggregate_to_pus}{Logical. If TRUE and \code{pus} is provided, aggregate the
data to planning unit resolution in GEE before export. This significantly
speeds up processing by eliminating local resampling. Default is FALSE.}

\item{wait_time}{Numeric. Maximum time in minutes to wait for the GEE export
to appear in Google Drive. Default is 5. Increase for large exports.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{\link[=download_gee_layer]{download_gee_layer()}}.}
}
\value{
A \code{SpatRaster} object of the downloaded Dynamic World data, or NULL if download failed.
}
\description{
Downloads an annual mode composite from Google Dynamic World. Creates a
pixel-wise mode (most frequent class) composite for the specified year.
Dynamic World provides near-real-time land use/land cover classification
at 10m resolution.
}
\details{
Google Dynamic World class values:
\itemize{
\item 0: Water
\item 1: Trees
\item 2: Grass
\item 3: Flooded vegetation
\item 4: Crops
\item 5: Shrub & Scrub
\item 6: Built Area
\item 7: Bare ground

\item 8: Snow & Ice
