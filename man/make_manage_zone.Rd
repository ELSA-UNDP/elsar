\value{
A SpatRaster with two layers: \code{manage_zone_v1} and \code{manage_zone_v2}.
}
\description{
This function identifies planning units eligible for the "Manage" zone under the ELSA framework.
The zone (default) includes areas with a moderate level of human influence (HII between
20th and 80th percentiles), all managed forest types, and agricultural and pastureland areas, but
explicitly excludes built-up areas. An alternative zone includes is limited to all
agricultural areas and pasturelands.
}
\details{
Two layers are returned:
\itemize{
\item \code{manage_zone_v1}: Based on HII quantile range, agriculture, and managed forests (excluding built-up areas)
\item \code{manage_zone_v2}: Simplified zone based on agriculture only
}

If \code{output_path} is provided, both layers are saved as a (multiband) Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG).
