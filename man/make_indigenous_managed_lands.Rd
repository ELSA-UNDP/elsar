\title{Create Indigenous Managed Lands Raster (LANDMark + ICCA)}
\usage{
make_indigenous_managed_lands(
  sf_landmark = NULL,
  sf_icca = NULL,
  iso3,
  pus,
  buffer_points = TRUE,
  output_path = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sf_landmark}{sf or NULL. Indigenous and community lands from the LANDMark dataset. Must be subset to the target country.}

\item{sf_icca}{sf or NULL. ICCA Registry features. Must be subset to the target country.}

\item{iso3}{Character. ISO3 country code used for output naming.}

\item{pus}{SpatRaster. Raster of planning units for alignment and coverage calculations.}

\item{buffer_points}{Logical. Whether to buffer POINT/MULTIPOINT geometries to create polygon representations. Default is TRUE.}

\item{output_path}{Character or NULL. Directory to save the final raster as a Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG). If NULL, the file is not written to disk.}
}
\value{
A binary \code{SpatRaster} where:
\itemize{
\item \code{1} = area is considered Indigenous-managed (based on coverage)
\item \code{0} = area is not Indigenous-managed
}
}
\description{
This function identifies Indigenous- and community-managed lands using two datasets:
the LANDMark dataset and the ICCA Registry. It buffers point geometries (if required),
combines them, calculates their fractional coverage over a planning unit raster,
applies a threshold, and returns a binary raster indicating likely Indigenous management presence.
