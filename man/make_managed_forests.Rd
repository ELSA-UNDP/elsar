\usage{
make_managed_forests(
  raster_in,
  pus,
  iso3,
  forest_classes = c(31, 32, 40, 53),
  include_disturbed_forest = FALSE,
  make_productive = FALSE,
  raster_npp = NULL,
  name_out,
  output_path = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{raster_in}{A \code{SpatRaster} representing LULC classifications.}

\item{pus}{A \code{SpatRaster} used as a template for extent, resolution, and alignment.}

\item{iso3}{A 3-letter ISO country code string.}

\item{forest_classes}{Integer vector of LULC class codes representing managed forests (default = c(31, 32, 40, 53)).}

\item{include_disturbed_forest}{Logical. If TRUE, includes disturbed forest class (code 20) in \code{forest_classes}.}

\item{make_productive}{Logical. If TRUE, also generates a productive managed forest raster.}

\item{raster_npp}{A \code{SpatRaster} of NPP data used for generating the productive forest layer. Required if \code{make_productive = TRUE}.}

\item{name_out}{Character. Name stem for output file(s) (optional, not currently used).}

\item{output_path}{Optional character. Directory to save output raster(s) if provided.}
}
\value{
A \code{SpatRaster} with either one layer (managed forests) or two layers (managed forests and productive managed forests).
}
\description{
This function generates a standardised raster of managed forests, optionally including disturbed forests
and a separate layer for productive managed forests (based on NPP data). The input raster should contain
LULC classification values which are reclassified according to defined managed forest class codes.
}
\details{
If \code{make_productive = TRUE}, the function multiplies the managed forest raster by a normalised raster of
Net Primary Productivity (NPP) to generate a layer representing productive managed forests.
