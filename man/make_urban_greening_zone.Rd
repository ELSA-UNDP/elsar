}
\arguments{
\item{iso3}{ISO3 country code (e.g., "NPL").}

\item{pus}{A \code{SpatRaster} defining the planning units.}

\item{built_areas_input}{A \code{SpatRaster} representing binary or probabilistic built-up areas (optional).
If provided, this takes priority over extraction from other inputs.}

\item{lulc_proportions}{A multi-band \code{SpatRaster} or list from \code{\link[=download_lulc_proportions]{download_lulc_proportions()}} containing
pre-computed class proportions. If provided and contains "built_area", will be used
if \code{built_areas_input} is NULL.}

\item{lulc_raster}{A \code{SpatRaster} LULC map used to extract built-up areas if not already provided (default: NULL).}

\item{lulc_product}{Character. LULC product used for class value lookups: "esri_10m" (default),
"dynamic_world", "esa_worldcover", or "local". When "local", \code{built_area_lulc_value} must be provided.}

\item{built_area_lulc_value}{Integer or NULL. LULC value representing built-up areas. If NULL,
automatically determined from \code{lulc_product}. Default is NULL.}

\item{built_area_threshold}{Minimum fraction for built-up area to be included (default: 0).
A threshold of 0 includes all urban areas, which is recommended since urban areas
are often small and should be preserved.}

\item{filter_patch_size}{Logical. Whether to remove small isolated patches (default: FALSE).
Defaults to FALSE because urban areas are often small and should be preserved.}

\item{min_patch_size}{Integer. Minimum patch size to retain (in raster cells; default: 10).
Only used if \code{filter_patch_size = TRUE}.}

\item{output_path}{Optional directory to write the result as a COG.}
}
\value{
A \code{SpatRaster} with values 1 (urban greening zone) and 0 (not urban).
}
\description{
This function creates a \code{SpatRaster} layer representing planning units where urban
greening interventions are applicable in the ELSA framework. The Urban Greening Zone
identifies built/urban areas where greening actions (e.g., tree planting, green
infrastructure) can be implemented.
}
\details{
This zone is simpler than Protect, Restore, or Manage zones as it has a single
primary input (built/urban areas). It essentially transforms the built area raster
into a formal zone layer for consistency with the ELSA framework.
