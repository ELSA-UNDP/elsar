\usage{
check_and_download_required_layers(
  data_info,
  iso3,
  input_path,
  gee_project,
  boundary_proj,
  wait_time = 5
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_info}{Data.frame containing \code{data_name} fields to match against requirements}

\item{iso3}{Character. ISO3 country code for the target country}

\item{input_path}{Character. Path where data files should exist or be downloaded to}

\item{gee_project}{Character. Google Earth Engine project ID}

\item{boundary_proj}{An \code{sf} object representing the country boundary}

\item{wait_time}{Numeric. Wait time (in minutes) for Drive export}
}
\value{
NULL (used for side-effect of downloading). Files are downloaded as needed.

\description{
This function checks for required layer names from metadata, ensures they exist
in the output path, and prompts the user to download them from GEE if missing.
Used internally by other functions to automatically download required datasets.
